# Admin UI Distribution Directory

This directory contains the built React admin UI that gets embedded into the Go binary.

## Important Notes

- **This directory must exist** for the Go embed directive to work (`//go:embed uidist` in `embed.go`)
- The contents are generated by running `./build.sh` which builds the frontend and copies the distribution files here
- Do not manually edit files in this directory - they are overwritten during the build process
- This README.md file is kept as a placeholder to ensure the directory exists in git

## Building

To populate this directory with the actual admin UI files:

```bash
# From project root
./build.sh
```

Or to build just the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
mkdir -p backend/pkg/ui/uidist
cp -r frontend/dist/* backend/pkg/ui/uidist/
```

## Contents After Build

After running the build script, this directory will contain:
- `index.html` - Main entry point
- `assets/` - JavaScript, CSS, and other static assets
- Other build artifacts from Vite

These files are embedded into the Go binary at compile time using the `embed` package.
